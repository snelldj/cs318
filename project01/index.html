    	The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Men's Volleyball is a great group of guys that play volleyball at a very high level. Eau Claire Men's Volleyball plays in the Wisconsin Volleyball Conference, and typically attends NCVF Nationals in the spring. We are very proud of our history with the program, having qualified for Nationals for over ten years in a row now, not to mention Top 10 finishes in each of the last four years. This year, Nationals takes place in early April, and we look to build on our recent successes. Click some links above to learn a little bit more about our program!
